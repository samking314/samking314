I am:
- looking for contract work involving: Node, Swift, React-Native, React, Redux, AWS and/or MongoDB (+ if has social impact)
- working on a fun project to optimize drone delivery paths in Python (a side project I've been working on and off for 3 years)
- inspired by Reggie Watts to build an app just about me hehe (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wattsapp-by-reggie-watts/id1489429381">Wattsapp</a>)
